"`::::::::: Use or indeed overuse of the words 'informer' or 'suspected informer' alone remains pejorative and inappropriate here. Angus's suggestion of ``suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute.  Sarah argues, ``What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer.`` She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself? And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer?  Sarah's other point that ``Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter`` is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics.  The number of Protestants in Cork who were home rulers would have been tiny and the percentage who supported the separatists minute and can pretty well all be named like Miss Dorothy Stopford or Sam Maguire.

"`  ==Kane's secrecy?== quote from the article: ``if the Allied campaign were to be completed in Red Alert, the Allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of Red Alert 2. It should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original Tiberian Dawn manual, which states that Nod is an African group in its origin, making no mention of the Soviet Union whatsoever.`` if the instruction manual was written by GDI, then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of Nod were.  Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to conflict, especially if it could be established that the manual was a GDI document, and therefore biased and uninformed.    : Please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime.

"`  == Energy Attack ==  First off, we can't even consider Shirah's ``unlocking`` scene to be canonical since it was only in the director's cut; the only true, verifiable incident of the ``energy attack`` is in Butcher Bay, in which Shirah doesn't touch him at all. Though she does talk to him, she never touches him like she does in the ``unlocking`` scene; for all we can gather, Riddick does this seemingly completely on his own, without Shirah's ``unlocking.`` Even more so, Riddick (after doing the attack) simply tells Abbott, the only surviving victim, ``see? Look at what you made me do,`` simply brushing off the incident. If you wish to get even deeper, because Riddick simply brushes it off, we could possibly infer that Riddick could have done this before, at least accidentally. In the end, we can't use the director's cut as a verifiable source (at least on this subject) until further notice (that is, if the next film uses director's cut-exclusive information).   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`  ::Of course we can mention the view point here even using Press TV as a source but it should not be stated as a fact and consequently we can't have it in infobox if press TV is the only source.     ::: I think what genuinely matters more than verbatim use of the term, is whether the source characterizes the movement as being one opposed to Imperialism which Wikipedia defines as ``a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means``. Having said that, the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term ``anti-Imperialist`` verbatim to describe the Houthis. Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the post-colonialist movements' struggle against imperialists and colonialists. Likewise, the author in the linked paper from Taylor & Francis identifies the same anti-imperialist themes in Hussein al-Houthi's thoughts. Furthermore beyond these sources, the very fact that Houthis' antagonists are well-known to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being anti-Imperialist in nature. Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence (namely US and Saudi) as already mentioned in the article. So I think it must be now obvious that the tag represents a definite fact, and restoration is well due.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`  ::: Four years after writing ``my vision is that Wikipedia should not say E is a fool when all it can really say is that D has called E a fool`` Lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article.  The preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the Eucharist in last supper, and cites the Catholic catechism, and Orthodox Encyclopedia and an Anglican Bishop.  Reading the footnotes, one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis.  And instead of reproducing quotes faithfully, or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability, the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors,  without even selective quotation.  On the positive side, I'm learning a lot about Eucharist-not from this Wikipedia article, I have to say, as much as running down footnotes,  I never knew the Eucharist was announced before the Last Supper until I read in the Catholic catechism.  That tidbit doesn't appear in any Wikipedia article I read.  The Last Supper is the institution of the Eucharist to Catholic, not the origin, according to the Catholic catechism cited here from 1993.

"`  :The About.com has been removed and cite templates added for un-sourced statements. Here is the breakdown of my edit that was reverted that I was told could be replaced due to no legitimate consensus dispute (keep in mind when I added this much info or sites the first time that I may have made a mistake with what got copied in the actual entry, hence some disagreements):  :   :*Happy Goodman Family, (NY Times, MTV and the group's website.)   :In the first sentence of NY Times: ``a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience``. The list of artists who are similar and influenced by the Happy Goodman family are on MTV's site (and doesn't even need to be included as it was just a ``verification`` source), among other statements to support what I typed are on the group's site: ``Their influence is still felt in many singing groups of today.`` Lastly, the info is covered on the singer's Wikipedia article. This is just one example of many I picked to ``open`` the statement about CCM's history or later changed to CCM's diversity.   :*Some other musicians who began making a significant impact in CCM (including on Christian radio) were/are Jon Gibson, Bebe & Cece Winans, David and the Giants, Rich Mullins, Carman, David Meece, DeGarmo and Key, Randy Stonehill, Keith Green, Kirk Franklin, and Steve Green, among many others.   :First off, the info to support these statements are already explained within the artist's articles that they are linked to. Jon Gibson is ``overly`` sourced on his article, I made sure of that as a user with a different user name/ip/id in the past. Secondly, iTunes/TCM/GMA/CBN/CCM and the radio sites as well as the artist's actual websites are valid sources. I removed all sources Walter said only had ``books`` and ``albums`` listed, although if [you] scroll down or look for a different tab to see the ``bio`` or ``description`` sections, it would confirm what my entry claimed. The above 17'ish sources listed in another section were ones I removed and I did not need to be advised what was wrong with them, they are only being ``saved`` for future reference. Third off, this article didn't give any diversity which was an element I wanted the genre to reflect. Within the About.com that was recently removed and within the actual article of the artists (ie. Randy Stonehill), this statement can be verified. It gives a better idea of the veteran and popular CCM artists that the article didn't mention, those who are significant and some award winning ``record breakers`` (if nothing else just diversity in race/nationality such as Carman and Kirk Franklin which I provided reliable sources for).  :``Word press``, ``CCM Top 500 albums`` and Kirk Franklin honored by CCM on his website are all valid points made on the credible sources I provided.   :*Contemporary Christian music also became popular with secular musicians as well, including Stevie Wonder,  Johnny Cash, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and M.C. Hammer (who vowed to God he would include at least one song of praise on each album). Bands like P.O.D. and Creed contained Christian themes within their lyrics yet still appealed to a secular audience.

"` :::Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many ``the Nazis`` does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the ``Nazis`` who came from ``Greenland or Mars`` or ``Nazi allies``. Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. ``The German-led Nazi occupation`` you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the ``General Government`` which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else.  Therefore he ``Nazi`` is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be. Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  `",0,0,0,0,0,1

Everyday I edit cities of Afghanistan but right away  reverts all my hard work claiming everything I add to the articles is POV or nonsense. I have 100% full information on entire Afghanistan and everything I add is also sourced. This User:Tajik has a serious problem with me over ethnic issues. For example: I added at the end of Herat article that the city is in control of the new Afghan government along with NATO forces being there assissting the government. However, User:Tajik claims this is nonsense and reverted the page. I rather not revert pages but settle the dispute in a nice manner on the talk page...something he does not responds to. I tried this on Kandahar talk page but did not get any responses from User:Tajik. I don't know what to do with this User:Tajik. It is not just one page he reverts but every page I visit. The reason for this is that his ethnics are from Tajiks and I am Pashtun. He does not trust western sources but relies only on Iranian sources. At one time he reverted 3 times in a row and when I reported him to another Administer {William M. Connolley), no action was taken against him. I would appreciate it if you could help me stop User:Tajik from vandalizing my edits. Thank You!  12:12, November 5, 2006",0,0,0,0,0,1
"`William Spindler Li is a Guatemalan writer and journalist. His works include fiction, poetry and journalism in English and Spanish. He is the author of a book of short stories, ‚ÄúExpediciones‚Äù, published in Bogota, Colombia in 2004 and an unpublished novel ‚ÄúPa√≠ses lejanos‚Äù. His non-fiction work has appeared in The Financial Times, The Spectator and the Encyclopedia of Latin American Literature, among others.  Spindler Li was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala, on 2 July, 1963. He was educated at the Liceo Guatemala school where he obtained a Bachillerato en Ciencias y Letras in September 1980. He completed his further education in London after his family moved there in 1981. In 1988 he graduated from the Polytechnic of the South Bank (now the University of the South Bank) in London with a BA (Hons.) in Modern Languages and International Studies. As a student, Spindler Li began to contribute articles, short stories, poetry and book reviews to various newspapers and magazines in the UK. He wrote both in English and Spanish, sometimes using both his surnames but more often shortening his name to William Spindler. While studying for a Masters degree at the University of Southampton, Spindler and other Latin American students founded the literary review Encuentros which published fiction, poetry and criticism. In 1996, Spindler obtained a PhD from the Department of Art History and Theory of the University of Essex, for his work on magic realism and the Latin American novel. His article ``Magic realism: a typology`` is often quoted in scholarly works on the subject.  William Spindler is currently a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), one the world‚Äôs leading humanitarian organisations, which helps over 31 million people around the world.

"1. If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work.  The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake.  Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable.  Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff.  Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races.  Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.  And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.  Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth.  I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is.  But for this self-proclaimed Tolkien enthusiast to pretend like he turned away from  D&D simply because of how the races were segregated is absolutely absurd.",0,0,0,0,0,1

One of the difficulties in assessing and addressing persistent forms of racial discrimination in Argentina is the lack of adequate information about the population, particularly the indigenous and immigrant communities. The national census scheduled for 2000 was postponed due to lack of funds. Historically, national census data has been collected using the category of national origin rather than race in Argentina, leading to undercounting Afro-Argentines and mestizos.  ",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`    ==Frustration with repeated deletions and un-sourced additions by Jrkso==  Jrkso,  I would like to think that you are editing in good faith - but you make it hard!  You seem to just pull ideas out of your head, delete well-sourced facts (repeatedly), and replace them with your personal concoctions - sources be damned.  Latest of many examples (for more, see Talk page, above):  You have now decided that the Taliban killed Sitara Achakzai, so you just plopped that into the article in the ``Government and Politics`` section.  You provide no sources for this ``new discovery``, no explanation.  You just went for it (adding bolded words, below):   ``Women in public life in many parts of the country are subject to routine threats and intimidation, according to a December, 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Several high profile women have been assassinated, but their killers have not been brought to justice. When Sitara Achakzai, an outspoken and courageous human rights defender and politician, was murdered by the Taliban in April 2009, her death was seen as another warning to all women who are active in public life.``  Do you honestly believe that you are contributing in a worthwhile way to Wikipedia with these methods?  Your seem to be intent not so much on re-writing the article, but on trying to re-write history itself.  No sources, no explanations, no sense.  And it gets worse.  On the edit page, where you again deleted facts, you seem to be explaining a deletion with this comment: 'Danieldis47, such a statement ... a ``transparent election is not possible.`` is POV ... how can that not be possible?)``    Man - It's a quote from the candidate himself!  It's HIS explanation for why he quit (not mine!)  That's why it is in quotes!  Would you delete an excerpt from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on Lincoln's page because it's his point of view (POV?)??

"`  :::The purpose of the normal curve equivalent is to solve the problems associated with using percentile ranks and stanines in statistics. It is inappropriate to use percentile ranks and stanines in statistics because these types of numbers do not have equal intervals between each scores. That would be like the inch changing in size from 2 to 3 and 7 to 8. The distance between percentile rank 1 and 2 is a different size than the distance between 49 and 50. The normal curve equivalent solves this problem. Therefore, it is incredibly useful when conducting statistics and is not a ``silly measurement.`` No measurement ``take[s] into account the... psychometric properties and content of the test.`` That's not possible. If you are correct in saying that the sample size impacts the NCE distribution, then it actually does take into account the performance of the students; however, my feeling is that it does not since it relies on the z-score. Either way, NCEs are indispensable when statistics on student achievement are necessary.`",0,0,0,0,0,1

The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"`==Street Gang== Mr. Davis,  Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be ``complete``.  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.  You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.  On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, ``They did all that for me!``  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`  :The problem is that by itself Wikipedia is not a reliable reference. Rather than try to use Wikipedia articles as refs for Wikipedia articles, which leads to a bootstrapping problem, it is better to go to the other article and then have a look though its refs and see if any are suitable to use in the first article. One thing to be aware of is that because Wikipedia is now ten years old that in some cases unreferenced information taken from it has been used in other articles and websites and then those have been used as refs for the original Wikipedia article, again creating a ``bootstrap`` problem of circular referencing. That way incorrect information can be widely spread and seemingly well referenced.  :As far as Aviation transponder interrogation modes goes, if all the information has been reincorporated back into SSR then I think it should be redirected back into SSR and not left out there. Otherwise we have two articles on the same subject that say different things. I have not checked to see if there are any useful refs in that article that could be transfered back.

They said I had to wait 3 months before I would qualify!!! I told them I have no income the day after my last day at work. They still did not care. Getting laid off in December is the worst month to get laid off in. Took me two months to find a job that is making what I was previously.

"1. Finish school.  If you're in the U.S., or re in any kind or public education, you are not going to learn much of value.  Why do I say this?  School exists these days primarily to shelve you during the work day.  So they have a full time job of giving you so much stupid work that you end up having idiot classes.  Also, communism.  Have you noticed you've had to take a bunch of retarded liberal arts stuff, but virtually no classes in market forced, entrepreneurship, business, finance, money, or anything else?  But there's plenty of idiot courses about history of somewhere that isn't local, sociology, psychology, and other useless things?  Fill that in with some language requirements, because that's helpful.  Sociology?  Does that help you with buying groceries?  How about saving, finance, investing, and math?  Much emphasis on that?  Maybe a bit of low level math.  But fuck your future, you'll be a good union worker and support the CCCP.  If I was to go through high school again, I'd learn as much as I could online, which is all free, about anything that's actually useful, and run out the clock at school, since it is nothing of value.  I'm pretty sure, from your post, you know how to read and write and I'm guessing up to at least an algebra level of math.  If you aren't going into STEM, do you need to know more?  No, because everything else is stuff you'll need to answer questions on Bar Trivia Thursday.  I wouldn't drop out of school though.  Now if you want to be an entrepreneur, learn about business entities, how to budget, how to do some accounting, payroll laws in your area, municipal and states codes and regulations, go down town and find out how to apply for a business license and what that means.   Learn principles of marketing, management, and accounting.  Even if all you're going to do is open a hot dog stand, which is a good first move  because it's cheap, simple, requires you to learn some regulation, and it's pretty much a break even operation.  Do some Uber of Lyft an run it like you're running a business, learn some budgeting, writing off expenses, do a balance sheet, figure out net profits, file some taxes, and all that fun.  Learn to do (if you're in the U.S.) your own 1040 for income taxes, even if you don't file them because your parents claim you.  Why?  Because schools don't teach a damn thing about how money works.  Because they want you nice and stupid and a good socialist.  ",0,0,0,0,0,1

I point out that your stereotypes about Evangelicals don't apply to everyone, and what do you do, you remove it? Am I supposed to stop being an Orthodox Catholic to edit Wikipedia? Or do you have to be a committed atheist to be ``credible``? It seems that you aren't interested in discussing the issues from an uninvolved third-person perspective, but instead it seems you use Wikipedia to grind an axe against Christianity. How can you say that the crop of articles your work on are neutral, when there are many inaccuracies and stereotypes, etc. about politically active Christians found within?  Christian Reconstructionism is an outgrowth of Calvinist theology, plain an simple. How can you say that I am POV pushing Does NPOV equal secular Leftism? The Dominionism article is heavily slanted to the Left politically, and I haven't violated any rules by posting a POV tag there. Much of what I have read form people such as Yurica, Bokaer, etc., is nothing but guilt by association. The edit warring has come from your side from the beginning. Chip Berlet is a political operative who isn't schooled in theology, and his observations paint with a broad brush, lacking historical insights into Christian views on Church and State. This isn't a personal attack. There shouldn't be a pro- or an anti-Dominionist bias. Your stated commitment to paint ``Dominionism`` as a threat is hardly NPOV.    `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"` STOP DELETING MY ADDITION.  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:  Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.  I AM NOT ``generally discussing a topic``, I AM NOT ``chatting``. I AM NOT    ``pushing a P.O.V.``.  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a ``general discussion`` or ``chatting`` or a ``point of view``.  It is a technically precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.  FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):  * There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.    * make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being friendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why   you hold it. Explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrate its validity to others and reach consensus.  * Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article; * Deal with facts  * The talk page can be used to ``park`` material removed from the article due to verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns discussed.  * The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.  * New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by other editors if you wish.  * Do not threaten people: For example, threatening people with ``admins you   know`` or having them banned for disagreeing with you.  * Editing  or even removing  others' comments is sometimes allowed. But you  should exercise caution in doing so, and normally stop if there is any objection.  As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public since there is no ``natural born citizen`` requirement that is applicable today. That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.  If I say ``No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal, shall be captured``, then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in  time.  Similarly, the requirement for ``natural born citizen`` only applied AT   THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at the foundation of the issue in the article:  No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.    `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"5. 				>How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling?  Because here is how it works: there are races, and within those races are ethnicities that are closer than ethnicities than other races. For example, Japanese marrying Chinese is more common than French and Chinese. Jamaican and Ethiopian is more common than Korean and Haitian. Irish and German is more common than Mexican and Nigerian.   So you see, it depends how detailed the metrics are. The fact of the matter is, broadly asian and broadly white and broadly black and broadly south american are no closer than they have ever been. In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before. Both in the West and globally. Pan-African supremacist movements are at an all time strength in the US. Nation of Islam openly states that white people are subhuman mutants, but they see all Africans and Caribbeans as brothers and sisters. Pan-European white supremacist movements see the entirety of Europeans as one group.   Welcome to the world as it is now.   >The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%).  This actually proves my point, the funny thing is you don't even see it because you don't understand this situation. White people see Hispanics as *closer genetically* than blacks. Closer *genetically* than Indians, than Arabs. The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the *small minority* of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white.  What do you think about that?  >If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist.   I guess racism is correct.  >Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines.  Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking. One cannot ""rate"" how unequal one group is to another, there are too many metrics.   It's clear to me that people like you are so comfortable with using these words you have never actually thought about how complicated they are. How do you measure a gay Korean against an orphaned Congolese? A trans German who is poor against a trans Jamaican who is rich? And compare both of them to a trans Aboriginal in a wheelchair? How many government services are afforded to each? Who deserves what? You have no idea. You are a gatekeeper on an infinite downward spiral you refuse to recognize.   >https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465300559028  What part of the paper proves your point? Quote it.

Show me the part in that paper that actually proves your point, you ""I just googled some shit and linked to a top result"" asshole.  >Sadly, this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the (mis)perceived threats posed by minorities.  >https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/perceived-threat-aboriginals-and-visible-minorities-255277  Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime. Here is a quote:  >When they looked at the size of municipal police departments in the 40 largest cities in Canada between 1996 and 2006, the researchers discovered that cities with more visible minorities have larger police departments after crime rates, budget issues, and the population are accounted for. In fact, standardized statistical tests suggest that the presence of visible minorities in a city is by far the most significant predictor of police force size across Canadian cities.  Again, *increased police presence is a deterrent to crime.*   Here's a fun link for you. This is an article about Baltimore after police presence decreased in the wake of Black Lives Matter:  https://www.npr.org/2017/12/31/574824963/baltimore-residents-blame-record-high-murder-rate-on-lower-police-presence  A quote:  >For the third year in a row, Baltimore, Md., has had more than 300 murders, reaching a new record of murders per number of residents in 2017.  >Some residents attribute the high murder rate to relaxed police patrols in the city following high-profile cases of police brutality. Officers have backed off in neighborhoods, like the one where Freddie Gray was arrested.   Again: **when you decrease the police presence, crime increases.**  Why?  **BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES.**  >Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime.   You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. *Especially* crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact.  >I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad.""   Yeah you did. You literally said diversity is a strength, you fucking retard.  >But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it.   The data shows otherwise.   Show me the data where adding Korean people to a company makes it more profitable. Show me the data where adding white people to a black company makes them more effective.   Show me the data where adding white people to aboriginal communities makes them better. My government has told me otherwise. I'd love to see this. ",0,0,0,0,0,1

I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit ``incoherent ramblings`` on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day.   Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an ``incoherent rambling``. But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having ``relations`` is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years.

"` :::::::The belief that Somalis are not black people stems from acceptance of Cartlon Coon's WP:FRINGE theories about a 'white race'. It is in accordance with this that, some WP:FRINGE edits try to push the WP:OR viewpoint that British Somalis are not black people at all. And yet, in the report about conditions for young Somalis in Britain, the authors described British Somali young people as ‚Äòblack and muslim‚Äô. Hassan.M H, Samater. H,M., Van Liempt. I,, Oakes. J., and Obsiye. M. (2008) In search for a united voice: establishing a London Somali Youth forum‚Äô http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/research/mobility-identity-and-security/migration-research-unit/pdfs/SYDRC%20May%20conference%20report.pdf] And, according to the acclaimed British Somali writer, Nadifa Mohamed, many young Somalis in Britain identify with 'a wider black culture'.Mohamed, Nadifa (2012) 'British Somalis Nomads No More' in The Guardian  And, when interviewed by 'The Ledge.com', Mohamed reiterated the point, declaring herself to be 'a black person'. Writer Nadifa Mohamed asserts her black identity. Meanwhile, Fryer, P (1984) notes that early 20th-century Somali residents did self-identify as black. Fryer quotes extensively from the 1928 autobiography of Ibrahim Ismaa'il, a Somali seaman and poet, who notes that 'Shortly after our arrival, the black people in Cardiff were attacked by crowds of  white people‚Ä¶ So we went to the Somali boarding house of Haadzi 'Aali and there we waited, ready for an attack, as we expected that a crowd of white people might break in at any moment'. Fryer, P. (1984) Staying Power: The history of Black People in Britian since 1504. Pluto Press[ (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Staying-Power-History-People-Britain/dp/0861047494/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1354045946&sr;=1-1] Commenting on resistance to 'colonialism and racism' in the UK, Adi, H claims that the 'first black member' of the Communist Party of Great Britain was the leader of Cardiff's Somali Youth League ``Mohamed Tuallah Mohamed'. Dabydeen, Gilmore, Jones. (2010)The Oxford Companion to Black British History. OUP.| http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oxford-Companion-British-History-Companions/dp/0192804391 However, Sabra Mohammed, speaking to the Guardian in 2012, reported that Somalis were  'attacked', for being black. Muir, H. (2012) Somali community in Britain begins to find its voice in 'The Guardian'.|http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/21/somali-community-britain-finds-voice Aspinall and Mitton identify Somali people in the UK as 'Black African' - firstly, by including them in their study of 'Black African' people in the UK, and secondly by using phrases such as ``Somalis Tend to live in household with OTHER Black Africans.``[ (my emphasis). In the 'moving here' glossary, which, the WP:FRINGE edit erroneously cites, the definition of 'black' is listed thus: ``Black British refers broadly to all people of African or Caribbean descent living in Britain.`` Thus, the general consensus in the UK is that Somalis are black people, from Africa ‚Äì albeit with a different heritage to West Africans or people from the Caribbean.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"1. >The project involves studying female engineering professors to ""lend critical insights into the social/technical divide"" that results in fewer women entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.  STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to high-functioning autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.  Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.  >The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the ""benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women.""  Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).  >Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities  The assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are worthwhile/matter. This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned this.  >""intersecting vectors of gender.""  What an unintentionally hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.  >If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study microagressions, so... that's an improvement I guess?  Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some important-yet-lower-tier research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.  Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming school/department, or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual wolf-half-human who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`==Correct and True Etymology of English words ``Myth, Mythology``== Greek ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ± ``legend, storytelling`` is derived from ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒøœÇ ``speech, thought, story, myth``, itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning ``an exposition of myths``. The current meaning of ``body of myths`` itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of ``untrue story``:  :``These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history.`` Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)  :::This is the earliest known usage of ``myth`` in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English ``fabulous`` doesn't mean ``wonderfully aesthetic``, it is the adjectival form of ``fable``, that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term ``myth`` was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things ``by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.``.  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define ``myth`` today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.     In 2005, a single-purpose account added ``mythology categories`` to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of ``mythology`` and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.    Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article ``Yoruba mythology`` to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term ``mythology`` is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from ``mythology``, but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as ``mythology``.  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran ``mythology`` either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today ``mythology``.       :Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as ``mythology`` for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of ``mythology`` for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.     `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`  BritishWatcher: Thanks for your courteous and transparent question (the first I have seen from the UK clique since I got ``involved``).  I'll address your second point.  If my answer to that is not clear, there is little point taking the time to suggest actual changes.  Your clarifying question mentions the premise that each part of the UK has its own subdivisions.  The article states this, but your phrasing implies that the parts are not themselves subdivisions.  The article says nothing about that.  Besides the lack of clarity on that point (assuming your reading is correct), there is another confusion in the article: I think the majority of the people reading this article will understand that the four countries are the focus of the article and that the title of the article (Subdivisions...) refers to them.  If it is the case that the parts are not themselves subdivisions, then the article is far from clear on this point (except to the three or four who have been ``involved``).  Hence, there are two confusions in the article: 1) the title suggests that the parts are subdivisions (because of the structure and general content of the article) and 2) since the article explicitly divides the UK into the four countries, this suggests that the parts are themselves subdivisions.  Your reading suggests that the title of the article should be ``subdivisions of the four parts of UK``, not ``subdivisions of the UK``.  Until these confusions are addresses, I think the article casts more shadow than light on the subject.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"  == Prior to viability ==  This was mentioned just above, but the 'before viability' statement in the lead is not true, doesn't match the full range of citations, and probably most importantly isn't an accurate summary of the article per WP:LEAD.  Whilst a number of the referenced texts do include viability as a measure, it seems that an equal amount don't, and the article does discuss abortion post viability.  In either case, viability is not a fixed point in time (apart from in a legal sense), leading the inherent confusion of the article apparently not applying to the termination of a 22 wk pregnancy, which could technically now be viable.  Now, in many cases late termination is due to foetal abnormality (at the 20 week scan, for instance), and the article does cover this, but for some reason, there appears to be this POV in the lead.    I have read the past talk, and the last discussion of this in 2012, a user laid out some very clear reasons why it wasn't appropriate, but the talk just fizzled out (with no real valid objections).  I suggest that remove the mention of viability from the first sentence of the lead would be more accurate, a better summary of the article, and probably also more credible.

There were database tables, subroutines and programs not being used.  There were very similar database tables. Programs that appeared to be running, but I couldn't find.  Without help from Stefan, I've had to wing it.  NicoV's WPCleaner also uses the translation files.  The ``script`` message were not being used by either project, so we decided to drop it.  ::What actually happens when a new error is added to wiki?  I'm certain that there are issues.   Matt asked if cswiki could get the new errors now.  cswiki is a ``small`` project that will be a good place to find and clean up any problems.  Your idea of the English message being default for any new errors and then a translation added later  is probably the way to go.      `",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`==Issues with your contributions== Spoilers are not the problem.  These are:  Infected crows that appear to be normal, but display a cannibalistic thirst for blood - you need to look up what 'cannibalistic' means.  A cannibal is one who eats its own species.  ===Rats===  Though they are completely harmless, they are still passed on as ``enemies`` from the games' official artwork galleries. They are also what is responsibe for spreading the T-Virus throughout Raccoon City and the Arklay Mountains, as well. - not enemies, basically.  A set of short, quadruple-mandibles and worm-like appendages, these are the most common parasites, bursting out of roughly 90% of all Majinis. However, they die about 1 second after busting out. They can only hurt you when their host is grabbing you, in whch case theycome through the mouth. - original research, game guide.  :*Cephalo: They appear as a single, very long, tentacle that protrudes out of the host's neck cavity and lashes out at the players. The first one is encoutered as a mini-boss from within Allyson. - game guide.  You also need to improve your spelling.  In addition, on some occasions after taking mortal damage, a host's torso will swell up like a balloon and then explode with great force, attempting to damage Chris and Sheva with a Kamikaze attack. - not a kamikaze attack, they're dying anyway.  It is very similiar to the Leech Marcus from RE0 and Leech Man from RE Outbreak, especially since they all typically require a human host as well. Ironically, it also requires a furnace to kill it, like the others too. - original research, and you need to look up what 'irony' means.  And so on and so forth.    `",0,0,0,0,0,1

Possibly because it's a bit closer to reality and thus harder to suspend disbelief. Maybe that's why Star Wars films never do crazy Force shit like pick up eighteen lightsabers and fuck everyone up or pull somebody inside out  Animation you can get away with that. Plus you never have to worry about anyone getting hurt, or actors getting too old for the role. I imagine a well made animated film is cheaper than paying for the CGI and actors too.

"`  The only reference that I found was a single line short reference in the article's reference #2, which states ``The indigenous Kert(Kurt) dynasty, a Tajik line related to the Ghurids, ruled at Herat as Mongol vassals during most of the 14th century``  The dynasty the article references, is not the Kurt, but in fact a dynasty established by the Kurds of Kurdistan, the Malik Kurd Ghor dynasty was established by Shamsuddin Kurd, governor of Khorasan, for Sultan Ghiasuddin Ghori, around 1245 A.D. He was confirmed in his authority by Mughal Emperor Hulagu, of whom he was a vassal, and greatly increased his power and authority in the reign of his succesor, Abaka Khan.  Shamsuddin was succeeded by his son Ruknuddin, at his capital, Herat, Afghanistan. Ruknuddin took Kandahar, Afghanistan, and died in the reign of Sultan Arghun Khan, around 1280 A.D. His brother, Ghiasuddin Malik Kurd, then succeeded, and was confirmed by the Mughal Emperor Aljaitu Khan in his command of Ghor to the confines of the provinces on the Indus river in Pakistan.  The Malik Kurd dynasty was extinguished around 1380 A.D., when Amir Timur (Tamerlane) took Herat, and slew its last prince and his son.

In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about.

In the South we had Virgil, Cicero, and Augustus before the Germanic Race could either read or write.`` This seems to be a promoting a sort of Mediterraneanism  the superiority of Mediterranean culture and civilization (though not necessarily race, although it might be implied) over the Nordic one.

"5. 				The entire reason Eddie in 616 goes to the church where he finds the symbiote is to pray for forgiveness before he commits suicide because he feels that Peter Parker ruined his life and cost him his job. The symbiote was freshly and forcibly separated from Peter, by Peter himself. The whole reason they decide to work together in the first place is their mutual animosity for Peter, plus the symbiote also wanting to return and re-bond with Peter. Venom, in 616, would not exist as he is if not for Spider-Man. Sure, a man named Eddie Brock can bond with an alien symbiote and take the name ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù, but when his motivation for doing so and the circumstances behind the event in question are so radically altered, it‚Äôs practically not the same character anymore. Just because two characters share the same name doesn‚Äôt make them at all similar, case in point mainstream comic Batman and Ben Affleck cinematic Batman who wantonly murders people.  Also, I‚Äôve read Venomverse. That series doesn‚Äôt explore what would happen if the symbiote never bonded with Peter and went straight to Eddie. Not in the main story, at least.

Approach the Humanities faculty at MU maybe or the head Prof at any uni that offers Indigneous Studies quals and ask can wik have some content so that what goes up isnt total nonsense.

Nobody gave a shit about this till sjws flooded in, I bought games that looked fun and didnt give a shit about male or female and only cared about whether or not they were well written, plot, gameplay etc. Such a non-issue that should be laughed at. Devs should make characters that are appealing to all because theyre likeable not to bigots who cant relate to someone unless they look, speak and act like them.    They pulled off a female character well in syndicate, I liked the twins and how they had their own playstyle. An assassins creed that has a female character that emphasizes more on skill and stealth would be cool, a feudal japanese era one with a kunoichi would be pretty awesome tbh.      I dont get the whole identify with the character you're playing thing honestly. You're playing a fictional fantasy game not rooted in reality, why do you need pixels to rep you and feel good about your gender its more important to relate to the characters as a person not a ""x or y"". you play games to pretend to be something you're not.

By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks.

"1. I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they supported...I found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute.   In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.

"`   Penis envy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.  Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.  In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals. Contents [hide]      * 1 Freud's Theory           o 1.1 Criticisms of Freud‚Äôs theory                 + 1.1.1 Within psychoanalytic circles                 + 1.1.2 Feminist criticisms     * 2 Male penis envy     * 3 See also     * 4 References     * 5 External links  [edit] Freud's Theory  Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in‚Äîand envy of‚Äî the penis in his 1908 article ``On the Sexual Theories of Children,`` but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).  The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).  In Freud‚Äôs psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events‚Äîknown as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls‚Äîresult in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.  For girls:      * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.     * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.     * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father‚Äôs penis.     * She develops a sexual desire for her father.     * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.     * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.     * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.     * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)     * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.  The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.  A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy‚Äôs father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.  Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1,0,0,0,0,0

"`    Follow-up.  You reduce ``false rape`` claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?  I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.  I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up. From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.  You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of ``sex by force``. You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as ``non-lethal force``. Similiar to another example, where people are ``just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you`` - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).  The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns.   God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.  Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.`",0,0,0,0,0,1

"`  ``Multiple editors on this page have repeatedly stated their opinion that this information is not relevant because it is not notable in Gordimer's life. Editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not, at this point, notable. The onus is on the editor(s) seeking inclusion of the material. lquilter ``  Three or four editors have censored the section in question; ten have maintained it. The three or four are very loud and aggressive, and claim to represent a consensus; that is just the  rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning (claiming that one's opinion represents the popular will, in order to con new people into adopting it, and thus bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy).  But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.  ``Editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not, at this point, notable.``  As lquilter well knows, I have responded many times. He is simply trying to rewrite history.  ``The onus is on the editor(s) seeking inclusion of the material.``   The heck it is. You and your two or three comrades have repeatedly deleted what nine people had worked on, before I ever came along. As you well know, I only got involved in this, because I was disgusted by your censorship; I still am.

It is important to understand that these uses of the term are not the same as Newton's more fundamental description of ``inertia`` as a principle of the way the universe works (which is not a measurable thing). ::In other words, some people sometimes use the term ``inertia`` to refer to other things than the principle of inertia.  However, the principle of inertia is still an important and valid principle, and is the primary meaning of the term.  In many cases, one needs to use context to determine whether somebody is referring to the principle or to something else, but I think we've pretty well established from the conversation above that we're talking about the principle of inertia here, not the (conventional but inaccurate) other uses of the term.

"` :: You can't trust the year shown by Google Books as it is very often wrong (one of my main peeves about it).  The Encyclopedia Americana you found is a 1970 edition even though it has ``1829`` written beside it; try searching for ``1970`` to see the copyright page.  The other examples don't work as ``heights`` or ``plateau`` are in lowercase and so are descriptions rather than names.  (In at least one of them, ``Syrian heights`` is clearly referring to the mountains rather than the plateau.) My Hebrew is primitive, but I suspect that example is also not clearly using ``ramat Golan`` as a name but is using a description analogous to ``Golan plateau``please correct me if I'm wrong.  So my question remains open.  On the other hand we don't have an article on the Golan region except this one so I am not completely opposed to covering a larger area. My main concern is that we carefully follow the sources in regard to use of names, and at the moment we have no source using ``Golan Heights`` for more than what Israel controls.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

The only justification for this deletion would be IAR in exceptional circumstances of real-life privacy violation or harassment. If it isn't that, then there is utterly no basis in policy or consensus. The discussion on AN, which I link above, bears that out. Courtesy blanking is better in such cases. g   :::It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like ``Your deletion is improper``.

I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.     ::::(ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide.

Secondly, El_C has some requests, namely that you try to watch yourself and tone down language that he feels is unduly insulting and offensive.

There is no truth in the statement that Buchman focussed wholly on the rich and famous. He devoted a great deal of time and attention to unremarkable people.   `",0,0,0,0,0,1

This is why on the Yugoslav censuses, ``Serb ethnicity`` was an option, which Selimovic selected.  :#The majority of the members of the Partizans and the Communists were Serbs, being a Serb and being a partizan/communist was not mutually exclusive :#Your implication that he changed nationalities from Bosnian to Serbian to spite Sarajevan ``harrasment`` is ridiculous because he was not addressing his nationality in the letter, but rather his ethnicity, which is an unchangeable characteristic. :#The Serbian language's standardization was devised by Karadzic in 1818, 17 years before the Croatian latin alphabet was standardized by Ljudevit Gaj, and 32 years before Serbo-Croatian was devised at the Vienna agreement. If you read Mesa Selimovic's books you would know that the modern standardized Serbian language is older than both modern standardized Croatian and Serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing Karadzic's reforms. Also there are Croatian and Serbo-Croatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized Serbian that Selimovic wrote in, namely Cakavian and Kajkavian. :#You say Biographies are reliable sources. Then read this excerpt from Selimovic's own autobiography ``Sjecanja`` that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation: ``Potiƒçem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin. Pripadam srpskoj literaturi`` -> TRANSLATION: I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE :You are clearly not a ``sane and neutral editor`` if you call me a bully and tell me to fuck off simply for adding relevant (the author's works deal primarily with ethnic questions in the Balkans) additional information and citations from the author's own autobiography to an article.`",0,0,0,0,0,1

The original town name of Middletown was spelled ``Mattabeseck``, this can be seen in the records of the general Assembly of Connecticut, which were QUOTED in this article until the ignorant and unscrupulous poster deleted the reference. This is significant in that southwestern Algonquin was spoken with a much harder inflection on the consonants, -and Mattabeseck is a southwestern Algonquin town.  Paragraph 2. Quotations about Puritan life in general are irrelevant in this article.   Paragraph 3. William Cronin is not a reliable source for local detail in Connecticut. Cronin's highly inflammatory accounts of the history of the settlement of America is very controversial, and has been shown to be very factually inaccurate and unreliable. It was very popular as a piece of political argument, and very poor historical scholarship.  That this article MUST include this kind of erroneous detail is unfortunate.

They know that for the a large swath of the public, the only reason they align a certain way is due to ignorance of the other side, often due to an overwhelmingly one sided media and education system. And those that step outside that line are ridiculed and looked down upon, without being given even a modicum of respect that they might be reasonable in their ideas. Instead, they're portrayed as hateful, irrational, or intolerant.  And the reason that's important is that they fear any exposure that isn't inherently telling you ""this person is wrong"" will lead you astray, because their own convictions are weak as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"` Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city.[1] On 30 December 2008, Staffordshire police stopped a car on suspicion of shoplifting, carrying three gang members and three young girls.[3] The girls had been reported missing from a care home in Derby.[3] The police drove the girls back to Derby, and during the journey, they told the officers about what had been taking place.[1] Derbyshire police force launched an undercover investigation called Operation Retriever, setting up surveillance and tailing the gang's BMW around Derby.[1] Detectives collected DNA samples from several of the crime scenes.[5] Siddique was wearing an electronic tag after a previous conviction for assaulting a woman.[1]  On 24 April 2009, two distressed teenagers stumbled out of a flat that was under surveillance and said that they had been raped.[3] The police had been unaware of their presence. The victims told the police of other girls who had been assaulted, and the police soon discovered a campaign of systematic grooming and abuse within the city. Detective Inspector of Derbyshire police, Shaun Dawson, said, ``When we arrested them, we had no idea of the scale of this. Once we had them locked up other victims spoke out and it snowballed from there.``[1] Debbie Platt, who led the police investigation, said she was shocked at the extent of the abuse and said it was like ``a campaign of rape against children.``[3] The police stated that the abuse could have continued for a lot longer.[1]  I'll start with the line ``Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city.`` - which simply implies the past. I believe that there needs to be clarity of time frames - otherwise it can be taken to mean that there has always been some paedophile gang operating in the city since the dawn of time! Are there any sources which place the time frame before 30 December 2008 with any degree of certainty (Decade - year - first known event) which allow for an accurately constructed time line to be presented. A generic reference to the past is not really good enough.   TTFN    `",0,0,0,0,0,1

The ``Samaritan of Europe`` began with the aim of being ``more effective in Christian charity,`` ``to heat up the lukewarm`` believers, and to ``convert those who had not met God`` (as stated in the Soci√©t√©; by Henry Dunant). The soci√©t√© quotes him as rejecting the Catholic Church and the State, but embracing the cause of the Gospel, empathethic with primitive Christianity, as well as talking about the prophecies of the Scriptures. In A memory of Solferino he calls ``gracious`` the self-sacrificing Christian devotion.  The two sources that claim that he became an agnostic ``in his last years`` do not point to any original source, nor have any documented quotation of him on the subject. Neither Oscar Riddle nor the NNDB give any reference to an original source to support their claims, which make their assertion unreliable.  While Riddle's ``evolutionary thought`` book claims that Dunant became an agnostic, ChristianHistory.net (from Christianity Today, claims that he was a Christian humanitarian to the last.  Inasmuch as there isn't a really reliable source to clarify this matter with documented writings by him, I seriously call into question the claim that he ``became an agnostic``, while many other sources say exactly the opposite.`",0,0,0,0,0,1

The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,0,0,0,0,0,1

Very ha ha, but also very serious, so pay attention after you're done with the giggles! |}   Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.  == Symptoms == * Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others * Assumes bad faith frequently * TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA) * Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about ``writing the encyclopedia`` * Impatience * Exhibits immediatism * Hangs out in project namespace * Has no time for featured articles * Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted * Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...) * Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life * Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll * Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons * Seems to enjoy biting new users * General BOFHness * Strict adherence to ``Wikipedia policy`` while not using common sense or conversely, * Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense * Self-denial. ``This page cannot possibly apply to me`` * Humor breakdown. ``This page is not funny`` * Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before * Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person * Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior * Believes he is the only real claimant to the ``Defender of the Wiki`` barnstar * Exhibits signs of MPOV * Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice * Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack * Indulges in biting delicious newcomers  == Diagnosis == It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness:   * You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!). * ``Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked`` is a recurrent thought. * ``Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)`` is a mantra, not anti-wiki.  * If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis. ** Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis. * If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected.  * And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.  == Pathophysiology == The infectious nature of this illness is unknown at this time.  More study needs to be conducted in order to identify transmission mechanisms. No effective containment mechanisms have been identified. So far anti-vandal bots have proved immune to this condition, although as yet there is no convincing explanation concerning this anomaly.   Observational studies have noted that sufferers will seek the counsel of their Wikipedia friends, but end up infecting them in the process. Other studies have noted the evolution of a Wikipedia editor as potentially having a causal role in this illness.   == Treatment ==   Treatment varies from case to case. As of 2006, no consensus exists on the best methods for recovery. Some methods that have been used: * Write some articles. That stuff on the pages with a white background. (You may remember it if you think back to when you started on Wikipedia.) * Taking a wikibreak (short or long depending on severity of infection) * Submitting an RfC with yourself as the party. Note: Can lead to worsening of the infection, if all your friends come out to say what a great person you are. Do NOT tell your friends about the RfC.  * Ask  for a second opinion * Self de-adminship.  == Prognosis and wikimortality == Mortality rates from this illness have not been clearly supported by research. Frequently, what appears to be a wikideath becomes a wikiresurrection in the form of a user who is considerably more circumspect, and often more detached from processes. Some resurrectees have exhibited shortness of temper, but with considerably lower flameout levels. Reinfection is rare, but if it occurs is almost always unrecoverable.   If the initial condition is not fatal, it may take months for a patient to recover, even if under the care and treatment of WP:ARBCOM.  ==Relation with Jimbo Wales== * Chides people by asking them how Jimbo Wales would react if he sees (insert your favorite example) a la asking how your mother would feel if she sees you doing (insert your favorite example). * Considers the Jimbo Wales article to be 's user space. * However argues that Jimbo is Big Brother whenever Jimbo's opinions go against him, but couches it in language such as ``benevolent dictator``.  == See also == *  If you are doing this, you have adminitis * How to win an argument (from Meta): the internationally accepted case description *  If you are doing this, you are fine, you do NOT have adminitis * Wikipedia:No vested contributors`",0,0,0,0,0,1

Don‚Äôt EVER make any stupid decisions while you‚Äôre inebriated otherwise you are a hypocrite.   Now, I didn‚Äôt put words in your mouth, I asked you questions. Feel free to try to actually answer them next time before trying to read me like a book and make assumptions about me (ironic, huh?)   You‚Äôre ONLY thinking about the safety of the cops here while also saying that violence against cops almost never happen there. Jesus christ, have some humanity dude.

Now, if this was a link to an article saying ‚Äúwoman sentenced to ‚Äòx‚Äô years for assaulting officers‚Äù I would be right there with you‚Äî it isn‚Äôt.

You guys keep talking about the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù threat she posed, how about we talk about the ACTUAL threat she posed which, according to the vide evidence, was slim to none. The officer got a few scratches. Boo fuckin‚Äô hoo. Here‚Äôs a band-aid.   It may be legal, but that doesn‚Äôt mean its right. The lady engaged in the violence, and the cop was sure to retaliate with thrice the amount of pain and ten times the amount of possible destruction that he could have caused on her and her life.   Let me ask you the same question I asked another guy, and please actually respond to this one: what do you do if you see an officer beating your wife/daughter/mother. You don‚Äôt know why the officer is there, he just is and, boy, is he rocking your loved one. Do you just stand by and shrug your shoulders? What if he kills your mother/girlfriend/aunt because of too much trauma to her brain? What then? Is he officer still in the right? ",1,0,0,1,0,0

"` :   ==Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Ivan ≈†tambuk==  Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a ``clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors`` is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).  ; Appealing user   ‚Äì     ; Sanction being appealed    ; Administrator imposing the sanction    ; Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.  ===Statement by Ivan ≈†tambuk===  see the unblock request  ===Statement by Sandstein===  ===Statement by (involved editor 1)===  ===Statement by (involved editor 2)===  ===Discussion among uninvolved editors about the appeal by Ivan ≈†tambuk ===  ===Result of the appeal by Ivan ≈†tambuk=== :This section is to be edited only by uninvolved administrators.

"`  There is no good hand / bad hand here, that's a total misuse of that concept, another attempt to smear me with no grounds whatsoever. This is not an ``alternate persona``, this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that. ErrantX, if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way, by trying to paint what were civil, polite queries, as a ``pursuit``, and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating I'm a coward, then I guess there's nothing I can do stop you given you've been entrusted with the power to do so. But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of WP:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of WP:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy. So, you just content yourselves that you've done something good here, and I'll just get back to my main account and do my thing there, and we'll see what the future holds for all of us.
